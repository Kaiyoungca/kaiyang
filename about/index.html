    <h1>About Kai Yang</h1>

    <p><strong>Positioning:</strong> I publish practical research on Blockchain technology & crypto, cross-border tools, and AI productivity — with a focus on decision-making and risk.</p>

    <p><strong>I research:</strong> how systems work (custody, security models, incentives), how to choose tools, and how to reduce irreversible mistakes.</p>

    <p>Based in San Francisco/Toronto.</p>
    <p>Operated by Red Pine.</p>
